# image_processing


This repository contains a collection of Python code samples for image processing using the OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries. Each code sample focuses on a specific image processing technique and demonstrates its application.

## File List

1. **`image_blur.py`**
    - Description: Captures video from the webcam and applies Gaussian blur to the frames.

2. **`canny_edge_detection.py`**
    - Description: Applies the Canny edge detection technique to an input image.

3. **`color_detection.py`**
    - Description: Detects and tracks objects of specific colors in a given image.

4. **`shape_detection.py`**
    - Description: Detects and labels shapes in an image based on the number of sides.

5. **`thresholding.py`**
    - Description: Demonstrates various thresholding techniques on an input image.

6. **`webcam_capture.py`**
    - Description: Captures video from the built-in webcam and displays frames with customized parameters.

7. **`scaling.py`**
    - Description: Demonstrates image scaling using different interpolation methods.

8. **`MediaPipe_Hand.py`**
    - Description: Initializes the webcam and uses MediaPipe to track hand landmarks in real-time.

9. **`masking_colour.py`**
    - Description: Implements masking to detect and isolate specific colors in an image.
